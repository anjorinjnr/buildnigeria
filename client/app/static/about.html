            <h2><strong>About BuildNigeria</strong></h2>
            <p>BuildNigeria was created to be the platform where the best minds and forward thinking Nigerians can contribute well-thought-out ideas toward rebuilding Nigeria.</p>
            <p>We set out to build this platform upon the realization that a lot of Nigerians are increasingly becoming passionate and interested in national development. Thanks to social media, Nigerians now actively express their thoughts and ideas using online platforms.</p>
            <p>The problem however is that it is hard to coordinate these ideas (from different people on different platforms) for the citizens and most importantly for the leaders who can ultimately act on the best ideas/solutions. BuildNigeria aims to solve this problem.</p>
            <p>Our goal is simple. Make it easy to discover and contribute ideas/solutions for Nigeria's development as a country! We have started out on a journey with the ultimate goal of making great ideas from Nigerians visible to the leadership of the country.</p>
