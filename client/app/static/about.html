            <p>BuildNigeria was created to be the platform where the best minds and forward thinking Nigerians can contribute well-thought-out ideas toward rebuilding Nigeria.</p>
            <p>We set out to build this platform upon the realization that a lot of Nigerians are increasingly becoming passionate and interested in national development. Thanks to social media, Nigerians now actively express their thoughts and ideas using online platforms.</p>
            <p>The problem however is that it is hard to coordinate these ideas (from different people on different platforms) for the citizens and most importantly for the leaders who can ultimately act on the best ideas/solutions. BuildNigeria aims to solve this problem.</p>
            <p>Our goal is simple. Make it easy to discover and contribute ideas/solutions for Nigeria's development as a country! We have started out on a journey with the ultimate goal of making great ideas from Nigerians visible to the leadership of the country.</p>

            BuildNigeria was created to be the platform where the best minds and forward thinking Nigerians can
            contribute well-thought-out ideas toward rebuilding our great country, Nigeria.
            <br/><br/>

            We set out to build this platform upon the realization that a lot of Nigerians are increasingly becoming
            passionate and interested in national development, and thanks to social media, actively express their
            thoughts and ideas on platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn.
            <br/><br/>

            The problem however is that it is hard to coordinate these ideas (from different people on different
            platforms) for the citizens and most importantly the leaders who would ultimately act on the best
            ideas/solutions. BuildNigeria aims to solve this problem.
            <br/><br/>

            Our goal is simple. Make it easy to discover and contribute ideas/solutions for Nigeria’s development as a
            country! We have started out on a journey with the ultimately goal of making great ideas from Nigerians
            visible to the leadership of the country.
