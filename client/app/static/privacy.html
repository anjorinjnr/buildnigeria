            <h2><strong>BuildNigeria's Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
            <!--<p>Last updated: May 4th, 2015</p>-->
            <p>We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes BuildNigeria's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the BuildNigeria service, via the BuildNigeria website, BuildNigeria content embedded on another website, your mobile phone, or through one of BuildNigeria's applications for mobile devices. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a ui-sref="terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

This information may be searched by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Web in accordance with our <a ui-sref="terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong> When you use the Service, we use persistent and session cookies and other tracking technologies to: (a) store your username and password; (b) analyze the usage of the Service; (c) customize the Service to your prferences; and (d) control the advertising displayed by the Service.

Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

            <p>We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g. IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g. GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Service), and may use that information to customize the Service with location-based information and features. If you access the Service through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provde us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.</p>

These third parties may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect similar non-personal information about your use of the Service. BuildNigeria does not control the third parties' use of such technologies and their use is governed by those parties' privacy policies.</p>

            <p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of young Children is especially important. BuildNigeria does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification or parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.</p>
