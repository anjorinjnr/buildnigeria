This has caused a painful decline in the willingness of many women to go to school.</strong></a></p>
                                    <p><!--<strong>Solution</strong>--> Once upon a time, there was a country where people did not have to worry about anything. All they had to worry about was putting food on their tables, getting their salaries and paying their children's school fees. How about we all move to a parallel universe where Boko Haram does not exist?</p>
